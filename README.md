# MachineLearningAlgorithmsCPP
Translate python code in the book "Machine Learning in Action" to C++

## k-NN
Use Eigen library to process matrix. Euclidean distance for calculating distance between vectors. The function datingClassTest separate the dataset into 2 parts, training and testing dataset respectively. And it evaluates the functions and algorithms by comparing the classification result with the real label in testing dataset.
