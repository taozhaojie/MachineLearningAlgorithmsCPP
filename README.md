# MachineLearningAlgorithmsCPP
Translate python code in the book "Machine Learning in Action" to C++
* Use Eigen library to process matrix.

## k-NN
1. Use Eigen library to process matrix. 
2. The distance calculating method is Euclidean Distance. 
3. The function datingClassTest separate the dataset into 2 parts, training and testing dataset respectively. And it evaluates the functions and algorithms by a comparison between classification results and real labels in testing dataset.
